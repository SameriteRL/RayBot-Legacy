# RayBot (Legacy)

A highly experimental Discord bot for general-purpose use.

The code is now mostly obsolete, and [a discord.py 2.0 rewrite is available here.](https://github.com/SameriteRL/RayBot) This repository is also missing some files required for full functionality that are now forever lost.

This project was initially created as a free-form "quest" project in senior year of high school; formerly known as QuestBot.
