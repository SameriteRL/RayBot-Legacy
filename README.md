# RayBot (Legacy)

A highly experimental and somewhat useful Discord bot aimed for general-purpose use, created initially as a freestyle project in senior year of high school. Code is now mostly obsolete in favor of a discord.py 2.0 rewrite (repository also missing some files required for full functionality).

Formerly known as QuestBot.
